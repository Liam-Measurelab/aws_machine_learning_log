## Course Overview
1. Lession 1: Introduction to course. 
2. Lesson 2: Introduction to Machine Learning – In this lesson, you will learn the fundamentals of supervised and unsupervised machine learning, including the process steps of solving machine learning problems, and explore several examples.
3. Lesson 3: Machine Learning with AWS – In this lesson, you will learn about advanced machine learning techniques such as generative AI, reinforcement learning, and computer vision. You will also learn how to train these models with AWS AI/ML services.
4. Lesson 4: Software Engineering Practices, part 1 – In this lesson, you will learn how to write well-documented, modularized code.
5. Lesson 5: Software Engineering Practices, part 2 – In this lesson, you will learn how to test your code and log best practices.
6. Lesson 6: Object-Oriented Programming – In this lesson, you will learn about this programming style and prepare to write your own Python package.

5. Welcoem to Machine Learning - Lesson 2 Start

### Lesson 2 
What is Machine Learning  
Steps in Machine Learning  
Real world examples  
 
#### What is Machine Learning
ML is a type of AI, automatically learn without being programmed, patterns and predictions
supervised learning - every training sample has a matching label or output label - predictions - sale price of house or image classification. 
unsupervised no labels. 
Inspect data to find patterns then humans use patterns to make insights. 
Reinforcement learning in what actions to take in situations to get max rewards. (Like a pet) 
 
Analyse problems and programs solutions - time taking and might be undoable. Because of edge cases. 
Machine learning - Models - Model training algorithm - predict outcomes that aren't partt of the data set used to train it, pattern matching that the problem solver would traditionally do. Flexiblity of the model is the key here. 

#### Components of Machine Learning

3 Primary components 
Machine Learning Model, Model training alghorithm, Model inference Algorithm.
Clay -> Raw -> Fired. 
Clay - Can be modelled into many different forms and purposes. 
Block of code or framework. For Example Linear regression model example. 
People attenting college based on cost of application eg. 

Raw Teapot - Inspect and analyse Clay and look at what to change to make it more like a teapot. gentle changes to model parameters to achieve goals. 
Determine what changes need to be made. 
Processes data and compares against a goal and makes small changes. Repeated step. 

Teapot - Ready for the real world. 
Generate preditions. 
Model inference
